Gamma Categorization - design patterns are split into three categories

Creational patterns
- deal with the creation(construction) of objects
- Explicit(constructor) or implicit(DI - dependency injection framework, reflection, etc.)

Structural patterns
- concerned with the structure
- many patterns are wrappers, good API design that makes objects usable

Behavioral patterns
- they are all different; they solve a particular problem, they solve it in a particular way
